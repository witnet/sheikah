      A wallet is an app that keeps your credentials safe and lets you interface
      with the Witnet blockchain in many ways: from transferring Wit to someone
      else to creating smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      You should never share your seed phrase with anyone. We at Witnet do not
      store your seed phrase and will never ask you to share it with us. If you
      lose your seed phrase, you will permanently lose access to your wallet and
      your funds.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      If someone finds or sees your seed phrase, they will have access to your
      wallet and all of your funds.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      We recommend storing your seed phrase on paper somewhere safe. Do not
      store it in a file on your computer or anywhere electronically.
